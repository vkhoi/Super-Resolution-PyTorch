# Collection of Super-Resolution models
This repo contains my implementation of many well-known super-resolution deep neural network (DNN) models. Each folder contains a separate model along with instruction on how to train, evaluate, and super-resolve an input image. This page acts as a summary on what models I have implemented and what I plan to implement next.

This is a just-for-fun project.

## Models
The following models have been implemented:
* Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network - SRCNN: [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.00092.pdf).
* Efficient Sub-Pixel Convolutional Neural Network - ESPCN: [paper](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Shi_Real-Time_Single_Image_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf).
