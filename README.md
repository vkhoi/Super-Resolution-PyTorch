# Collection of Super-Resolution models
This repo contains my implementation of many well-known super-resolution deep neural network (DNN) models. Each folder contains a separate model along with instruction on how to train, evaluate, and super-resolve an input image. This page acts as a summary on what models I have implemented and what I plan to implement next.

This is a just-for-fun project.

## Models
The following models have been implemented:
* SRCNN - Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network: [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.00092.pdf).
* ESPCN - Efficient Sub-Pixel Convolutional Neural Network: [paper](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Shi_Real-Time_Single_Image_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf).
* FSRCNN - Accelerating the Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network: [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.00367.pdf).
* LapSRN - Fast and Accurate Image Super-Resolution with Deep Laplacian Pyramid Networks: [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.01992.pdf).
