# Collection of Super-Resolution models
This repo contains my implementation of many well-known super-resolution deep neural network (DNN) models. Each folder contains a separate model along with instruction on how to train, evaluate, and super-resolve an input image. This page acts as a summary on what models I have implemented and what I plan to implement next.

This is a just-for-fun project.

## Models
The following models have been implemented:
